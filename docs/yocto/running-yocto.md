# Running your Custom Linux Distribution

Once you turn on your Raspberry Pi with the Linux distribution loaded into the Micro-SD card, it should boot into a virtual console asking you to log in. The system should have only one user: **root**. You can log into the system by entering root as the username, and leaving the password blank and pressing enter. Given that a minimal build was created, you should only really have access to the basic GNU commands.

If you have reached this stage then **congratulations!**, you have made your own custom Linux distribution! You may notice that it is a bit bare at the moment, but the beauty of it is that you can add or remove whatever you want. It's essentially a blank canvas for you to play with!
