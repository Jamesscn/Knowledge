# Knowledge is Power

> *"Skill to do comes of doing; knowledge comes by eyes always open, and working hands; and there is no knowledge that is not power."* - **Ralph Waldo Emerson**

Welcome to my knowledge sharing website, where you can find miscellaneous tutorials, guides and other material on topics I have experience with. I decided to make this website to give something back to the world because most of the knowledge I have acquired has come from websites, videos and other excellent internet resources. If you have any suggestions, comments or other matters, feel free to reach out to me at my personal email: <jamesscn@gmail.com>
